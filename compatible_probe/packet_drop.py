# Probe using the fact GFW will configure some router to only drop packet of certain source ip and port combination
#
# Normally GFW does not drop your packet, it will jam the connection using TCP RST or FAKE DNS ANSWER.
# However, if you are running some OpenVPN like service on the server and being detected *somehow* by GFW,
# it will block your ip or just a specific port of that ip. We can use the fact some router is dropping packet
# to show its connection with GFW.
#
# Send offending payload (A.K.A source port being the blocked port) with TTL 1
# PROBE =OFFENDING_PAYLOAD=> ROUTER-1 (TTL is 1)
# PROBE <=ICMP_TTL_EXCEEDED= ROUTER-1
# Router will send back a ICMP packet tell us its (the router) ip address
#
# Send offending payload (A.K.A source port being the blocked port) with big enough TTL
# PROBE =OFFENDING_PAYLOAD => ROUTER-1 .. => ROUTER ATTACHED GFW (TTL is N)
# PROBE <=NOTHING= (Nothing returned after 2 seconds)
# We know the router is dropping our packet as no ICMP being returned
#
# Send non-offending payload (A.K.A source port being the reference port) with big enough TTL
# PROBE =NON_OFFENDING_PAYLOAD => ROUTER-1 .. => ROUTER ATTACHED GFW (TTL is N)
# PROBE <=ICMP_TTL_EXCEEDED= ROUTER-1 .. <= ROUTER ATTACHED GFW
# Although the router ip returned from this ICMP might not be same router, as source port was not the same.
# But there is a great chance the router is the same router, as we can tell same router is responsible for
# TCP RST and FAKE DNS ANSWER.
